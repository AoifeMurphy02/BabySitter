## :star2: Overview

The BabySitter Monitoring System is a Raspberry Pi-based project designed to provide comprehensive monitoring of a baby while they are in their crib. The system captures visual, audio, and environmental data, allowing parents to keep track of their baby's well-being remotely. It integrates with AWS for cloud-based monitoring and uses PubNub for real-time communication.
